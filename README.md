## `JavaScript Coding Assessment`

### Objective:

> In this task, you will create a simple search filter using JavaScript. The application should be a basic HTML page that fetches quote data from an API and displays quote texts. If the user enters a string in the text field, the application should show only quotes whose text contains the entered string.


### Requirements:
> - Use the Dummy JSON API (https://dummyjson.com/quotes) to fetch quote data. The API has no usage limits and doesn't require an API key.
> - Create an HTML page that displays the quote texts as a list.
> - Implement a text input field that allows the user to filter the quote list by entering a string.
>- The filter should only display quotes whose text contains the entered substring.
>- The data should be fetched from the API only once, and the results should be filtered using JavaScript.
>- Display an error message if the API call fails
